                <h1>Introduction to Trigonometry</h1>
                <p>Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the relationship between the ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle with its angles.</p>
                <h1>Trignometry basics</h1>
                <p>Trigonometry basics deal with the measurement of angles and problems related to angles. There are three basic functions in trigonometry: sine, cosine, and tangent. These three basic ratios or functions can be used to derive other important trigonometric functions: cotangent, secant, and cosecant. All the important concepts covered under trigonometry are based on these functions. Hence, further, we need to learn these functions and their respective formulas at first to understand trigonometry.</p>
                <h1>Trignometric ratios</h1>
                <p>There are basic six ratios in trigonometry that help in establishing a relationship between the ratio of sides of a right triangle with the angle. If θ is the angle in a right-angled triangle, formed between the base and hypotenuse, then</p>

                <p>sin θ = Perpendicular/Hypotenuse</p>
                <p>cos θ = Base/Hypotenuse</p>
                <p>tan θ = Perpendicular/Base</p>
                <p>The value of the other three functions: cot, sec, and cosec depend on tan, cos, and sin respectively as given below.</p>

                <p>cot θ = 1/tan θ = Base/Perpendicualr</p>
                <p>sec θ = 1/cos θ = Hypotenuse/Base</p>
                <p>cosec θ = 1/sin θ = Hypotenuse/Perpendicular</p>

                <h1>Trignomeric angles</h1>
                <p>Trigonometric angles are the angles in a right-angled triangle using which different trigonometric functions can be represented. Some standard angles used in trigonometry are 0º, 30º, 45º, 60º, 90º. The trigonometric values for these angles can be observed directly in a trigonometric table. Some other important angles in trigonometry are 180º, 270º, and 360º. Trigonometry angle can be expressed in terms of trigonometric ratios as,</p>

                <p>θ = sin-1 (Perpendicular/Hypotenuse)</p>
                <p>θ = cos-1 (Base/Hypotenuse)</p>
                <p>θ = tan-1 (Perpendicular/Base)</p>
                <h1>List of trignometric formulas</h1>
                <P>There are different formulas in trigonometry depicting the relationships between trigonometric ratios and the angles for different quadrants. The basic trigonometry formulas list is given below:</p>

                <br>
                cot θ = 1/tan θ = Adjacent Side/Opposite Side
                <br>
                sec θ = 1/cos θ = Hypotenuse/Adjacent Side
                <br>
                cosec θ = 1/sin θ = Hypotenuse/Opposite Side

                a2 = b2 + c2 – 2bc cos A
                <br>
                b2 = a2 + c2 – 2ac cos B
                <br>
                Here a, b, c are the lengths of the sides of the triangle and A, B, and C are the angle of the triangle.

                <b>What is Trigonometry in maths?</b>
                <p>
                    Trigonometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the study of the relationship between the sides of a triangle (right-angled triangle) and its angles. The relationship is presented as the ratio of the sides, which are trigonometric ratios. The six trigonometric ratios are sine, cosine, tangent, cotangent, secant, and cotangent.</p>
                <br>
                <b>What are the applications of Trignometry?</b>
                <p>Trigonometry finds applications in different fields in our day-to-day lives. In astronomy, trigonometry helps in determining the distances of the Earth from the planets and stars. It is used in constructing maps in geography and navigation. It can also be used in finding an island's position in relation to the longitudes and latitudes. Even today, some of the technologically advanced methods which are used in engineering and physical sciences are based on the concepts of trigonometry</p>
                <br>
                <p>Q. The building is at a distance of 150 feet from point A. Can you calculate the height of this building if tan θ = 4/3 using trigonometry?</p>
                <br>
                <b>Solution</b>

                <p>The base and height of the building form a right-angle triangle. Now apply the trigonometric ratio of tanθ to calculate the height of the building.</p>
                <br>
                In Δ ABC, AC = 150 ft, tanθ = (Opposite/Adjacent) = BC/AC
                <br>
                4/3 = (Height/150 ft)
                <br>
                Height = (4×150/3) ft = 200ft
                <br>
                Answer: The height of the building is 200ft.
